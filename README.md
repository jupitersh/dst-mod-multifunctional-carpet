# Multifunctional Carpet

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Carpeted turf, checked turf and wooden turf will have more function other than decoration.

In the game, there is no house for us to proof the rain, keep warm, provide safety, etc.

But with this mod:

When you stand on the floors, it will insulate you from freezing and overheating, proof the rain and gain sanity like wearing a top hat, which is like being "indoors".

Have fun!
